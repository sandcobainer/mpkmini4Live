# mpkmini4Live

This project builds a control script to control Ableton Live effectively using the basic Akai MPK Mini. The control script was written using Max4Live.

The device .amxd needs to be placed on a MIDI track with monitoring 'In'selected. The USB MIDI controller is connected in the same way as any other MIDI controller. However, the AKAI MPK Mini stock presets will need to be edited using AKAI MPK Mini Editor. (inside MPKWin folder)


**MacOS Mojave users** may not be able to run the MPK Mini editor just like me, so I've included the Windows version (.exe file). This run smoothly on Mac OS using wine. 
run wine MPK\ MINI\ Editor.exe from your Terminal.

I haven't used MPK Mini MKII but I would assume most of the functionality will be intact if you upload the presets. 

Do contact me if you run into problems.
